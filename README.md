# WeatherPrediction

This is very dynamic process because it is adapting on the conditionals having a rigid prior experience (initial state of a system) and also with the conditionals injected by the user. 
It then infers and gives the probability.
What is important is that the probable state of any outcome ( which is not observed yet ) is the key here for the most advanced system. This is just a simple deployment but when we look at the system which can infer as well as gives another set of probable state of "why it infered in such way" then the system will be very smart.
